# Preflop-Heads-Up-Solver
This allows you to calculate the optimal pushing range AND calling range for a heads up scenario. Input the effective stack (and you can also edit the number of iterations to run) and this solver uses multiprocessing to quickly calculate the optimal shoving and calling strategies, trying to reach Nash Equilibria as closely as possible.
